# Statistical_Methods_for_Language_Processing_2024W
This project explores the basics of statistics and the application of its methods within the context of language processing by analysing a literary text from the Project Gutenberg library. Using RStudio, a statistical programming environment, and leveraging tools such as the “gutenbergr” package, the chosen text is subjected to computational analysis to derive insights into its linguistic structure and statistical properties.

It involves the following tasks:
- Task 1: Install Libraries and Load the Text
- Task 2: Word and Bigram Counts
- Task 3: Dependence of Words
- Task 4: Hypothesis Test and Chi-Square Test Explained
- Task 5: Computing Entropy
- Task 6: Entropy of a Random Variable Explained
- Task 7: Computing Confidence Interval
- Task 8: Confidence Interval Explained
- Task 9: Naïve Bayes Classifier

Conclusion:
This project explored various basic statistical concepts and principles that are underlying
methods for machine learning. The project provided also a chance to code in a new
environment, namely the RStudio, and showed how fast, simple and playful could various
statistical tasks be. It proved that the statistical foundations are very much needed for text
analysis or classification tasks, when linguistic data can be effectively analyzed using various
statistical methods.
